# Linear-Regression-Three-Different-Ways
We implement linear regression model using three Python packages: scikit-learn, numpy, and tensorflow. The main goal is to compare the performances of the three implementations. This project is based on an assignment from the course "Guided Tour of Machine Learning in Finance" (NYU) offered on Coursera.
